# Tap Crisis - Development Reference

## Project Overview
A hybrid mobile on-rails shooter built in Godot 4.2+ with Time Crisis-style cover mechanics. Players move between cover points with swipe gestures, step out to shoot, and use tactical cover positioning.

## Architecture Overview

### Core Systems
1. **Cover System** - Manages cover points and player positioning
2. **Camera Controller** - Handles camera movement and targeting
3. **Player Controller** - Controls player animations and shooting
4. **Game Manager** - Orchestrates game flow and level progression

---

## Cover System

### CoverPoint (`scripts/core/cover_point.gd`)

**Purpose:** Defines positions where the player can take cover, with left/right side support and automatic anchor generation.

**Key Properties:**
```gdscript
@export var height: CoverHeight = CoverHeight.MEDIUM  # MEDIUM or TALL
@export_flags("Left:1", "Right:2") var active_sides: int = 3  # Both sides by default
@export var cover_name: String = ""  # For debugging

# Camera settings
@export var left_fov: float = 75.0
@export var right_fov: float = 75.0

# Movement timing (per-cover customization)
@export var camera_transition_duration: float = 1.5
@export var player_movement_duration: float = 0.8
@export var transition_ease_type: Tween.EaseType = Tween.EASE_IN_OUT
```

**Automated Anchor System:**
Each cover automatically generates 4 anchor points:
- **PlayerAnchor_Left** - Ground-level position marker for left side (manually adjustable)
- **PlayerAnchor_Right** - Ground-level position marker for right side (manually adjustable)
- **CameraAnchor_Left** - Camera position for left side view (auto-positioned by height)
- **CameraAnchor_Right** - Camera position for right side view (auto-positioned by height)

**Cover Height & Animations:**
- **MEDIUM**: Player uses crouch animation, camera at 1.2m
- **TALL**: Player uses standing animation, camera at 1.6m
- **Player anchors** are created at ground level (y=0) as position markers only
- **Player height** is controlled by animation, not anchor position
- **Camera anchors** are automatically positioned based on cover height

**Node Structure:**
```
CoverPoint (Node3D)
├── PlayerAnchor_Left (Marker3D) - Auto-generated
├── PlayerAnchor_Right (Marker3D) - Auto-generated
├── CameraAnchor_Left (Marker3D) - Auto-generated
├── CameraAnchor_Right (Marker3D) - Auto-generated
├── Path_Left_Camera (Path3D) - Optional custom paths
├── Path_Left_Player (Path3D) - Optional custom paths
└── (... more paths)
```

**Simplified Workflow:**
1. **Place CoverPoint** - Add CoverPoint node to your scene
2. **Set Height** - Choose MEDIUM or TALL in Inspector
3. **Click "Setup Cover Anchors"** - Creates all 4 anchors (camera auto-positioned, player at ground level)
4. **Position Player Anchors** - Manually adjust PlayerAnchor_Left and PlayerAnchor_Right positions as needed
5. **Connect Covers** - Set left_cover, right_cover, forward_cover, back_cover references
6. **Create Paths** - Use the path creation buttons to connect anchors with custom paths

**Note:** Camera anchors are automatically positioned based on cover height. Player anchors are created at ground level (y=0) for you to position manually where the player should stand.

## Camera Controller

### CameraController (`scripts/core/camera_controller.gd`)

**Purpose:** Manages camera movement between cover points and handles touch/mouse input for aiming.

**Key Properties:**
```gdscript
@export var camera_move_speed: float = 5.0  ## Speed of camera transitions
@export var look_sensitivity: float = 0.002  ## Mouse/touch look sensitivity
@export var vertical_look_limit: float = 60.0  ## Max vertical rotation (degrees)
```

**Architecture - Camera as Controller:**
The camera IS the player controller. This is different from traditional FPS:
- Camera processes all input (touch, swipe, tap)
- Camera tells GameManager to move player between covers
- Camera raycasts from its position to determine shooting targets
- No separate "player input controller"

**Node Structure:**
```
CameraController (Camera3D)
└── (No children needed)
```

**Input Handling:**
- **Tap/Click**: Shoots at world position under cursor
- **Swipe**: Moves between cover points (detected via drag start/end)
- **Drag**: Aims camera (rotates around current position)

**Camera Movement:**
```gdscript
func move_to_cover(cover_point: CoverPoint, side: String):
    # Smoothly interpolates to cover anchor position + rotation
    # Uses exact transform from CameraAnchor, no look_at
```

**Shooting:**
```gdscript
func _handle_tap(position: Vector2):
    # Raycast from camera through screen position
    # Tells player to shoot at world position
    # Player handles animation and timing
```

---

## Player Controller

### PlayerController (`scripts/core/player_controller.gd`)

**Purpose:** Manages player animations, shooting timing, and state transitions.

**States:**
```gdscript
enum State {
    IN_COVER,      # Player behind cover, can shoot
    SHOOTING,      # Player stepped out, firing
    MOVING,        # Transitioning between covers
    VULNERABLE     # Player exposed, can take damage
}
```

**Key Properties:**
```gdscript
@export_group("Animation Timing")
@export var step_out_speed: float = 1.0  ## Animation speed multiplier
@export var step_in_delay: float = 0.3   ## Delay before returning to cover

@export_group("Combat")
@export var shoot_cooldown: float = 0.2  ## Time between shots
```

**Animation System (Current Implementation):**

Uses AnimationTree with BlendSpace1D for smooth directional blending:

```
AnimationTree
└── BlendSpace1D (step)
    ├── blend_position: -1.0 → step_left animation
    ├── blend_position: 0.0 → RESET animation (in cover)
    └── blend_position: 1.0 → step_right animation
```

**How Animation Works:**
1. Player starts at cover (blend_position = 0.0)
2. When shooting:
   - If cover_side == "left": blend_position = -1.0 (step left)
   - If cover_side == "right": blend_position = 1.0 (step right)
3. Animation plays at speed controlled by `step_out_speed`
4. After `step_in_delay`, blend_position returns to 0.0 (step back in)

**Shooting Flow:**
```
Player taps screen
    ↓
Camera raycasts to world position
    ↓
Camera calls player.shoot_at_position()
    ↓
Player sets blend_position (step out animation)
    ↓
Animation completes (0.15s / step_out_speed)
    ↓
Fire weapon immediately
    ↓
Wait step_in_delay
    ↓
Return to cover (blend_position = 0.0)
```

**Node Structure:**
```
Player (CharacterBody3D)
├── CollisionShape3D (Capsule)
├── Model (Node3D) ← Animation target
│   └── PlayerMesh (placeholder capsule)
├── ShootOrigin (Node3D) - Gun muzzle position
├── ShootRaycast (RayCast3D) - Hit detection
├── AnimationPlayer - Plays individual animations
└── AnimationTree - Blends animations via BlendSpace1D
```

**Cover Movement:**
```gdscript
func move_to_cover(cover_point: CoverPoint, side: String):
    current_state = State.MOVING
    current_cover = cover_point
    current_side = side

    # Snap to cover position
    global_position = cover_point.global_position
    global_rotation = cover_point.global_rotation

    current_state = State.IN_COVER
```

---

## Game Manager

### GameManager (`scripts/core/game_manager.gd`)

**Purpose:** Central coordinator for game state, cover navigation, and level flow.

**Key Responsibilities:**
- Maintains list of cover points in current level
- Handles cover-to-cover navigation
- Tracks current cover and side
- Manages game state (playing, paused, etc.)

**Cover Navigation:**
```gdscript
func move_to_next_cover():
    # Finds next cover point in sequence
    # Tells player to move
    # Tells camera to transition
```

**Initialization:**
```gdscript
func _ready():
    # Find camera and player references
    # Collect all CoverPoint nodes
    # Start at first cover point
```

---

## Animation System Deep Dive

### Current System: Procedural Animation with BlendSpace1D

**Implementation Location:**
- Scene: `scenes/player/player.tscn`
- Script: `scripts/core/player_controller.gd`

**Animation Definitions:**
Three animations in AnimationLibrary:

1. **RESET** (0.001s)
   - Resets Model position to (0, 0, 0)
   - Used as "in cover" pose

2. **step_left** (0.15s)
   - Moves Model from (0,0,0) to (-0.4, 0, 0)
   - Cubic interpolation for smooth motion

3. **step_right** (0.15s)
   - Moves Model from (0,0,0) to (0.4, 0, 0)
   - Cubic interpolation for smooth motion

**BlendSpace1D Configuration:**
```gdscript
blend_point_0/pos = -1.0  → step_left
blend_point_1/pos = 0.0   → RESET
blend_point_2/pos = 1.0   → step_right
blend_mode = 1            → Interpolated blending
```

**Why BlendSpace instead of State Machine:**
- Allows smooth blending between left/right/center
- Single parameter control (blend_position)
- No complex transition logic needed
- Can later add diagonal blend positions

**Control from Code:**
```gdscript
# Step out left
animation_tree.set("parameters/step/blend_position", -1.0)

# Return to cover
animation_tree.set("parameters/step/blend_position", 0.0)

# Step out right
animation_tree.set("parameters/step/blend_position", 1.0)
```

### Future System: Root Motion with Rigged Character

**Current Limitation:**
- Animations move child Model node, not character root
- Placeholder capsule mesh only
- No character skeleton/bones

**When Adding Rigged Character:**

1. **Character Requirements:**
   - Armature/Skeleton3D with skinned mesh
   - Animations that move the armature root (root motion)
   - Animation names: idle, step_left, step_right, shoot

2. **Integration Steps:**
   - Import character into `res://characters/`
   - Instance as child of Player's Model node
   - Update AnimationTree to point to character's AnimationPlayer
   - Update AnimationNodeAnimation names to match character's animations
   - Character's armature will move, carrying skinned mesh

3. **Root Motion Benefits:**
   - Animator controls exact movement in animation software
   - Character body animation matches positional movement
   - Can have complex multi-step animations
   - Easy to iterate in animation software

4. **No Code Changes Needed:**
   - player_controller.gd already controls blend_position
   - Timing properties already exported
   - System automatically uses character's animations

**Setup Checklist for Rigged Character:**
```
□ Character has idle/step_left/step_right animations
□ Animations include armature root movement
□ Import character model (.gltf/.fbx)
□ Instance under Player/Model node
□ Update AnimationTree anim_player path: "Model/YourCharacter/AnimationPlayer"
□ Update AnimationNodeAnimation resources with animation names
□ Test - animations should play automatically
```

## Key Design Decisions

### 1. Camera-as-Controller Architecture
**Why:** Mobile-first design where touch input naturally maps to camera space
**Benefit:** Simplified input handling, intuitive screen-space interactions

### 2. Animation-Driven Movement
**Why:** Ensures movement timing matches visual animation
**Benefit:** Responsive feel, easy to tune timing without code changes

### 3. BlendSpace1D for Cover Animation
**Why:** Smooth blending between directional poses
**Benefit:** Can add intermediate poses (45° angles) without state machine complexity

### 4. No Camera Look-At Behavior
**Why:** Designers need full control over camera composition
**Benefit:** Can pre-compose dramatic angles, no fighting automated aiming

### 5. Cover Anchors Store Full Transform
**Why:** Position + Rotation control from single node
**Benefit:** Fast iteration, visual editing in Godot editor

## Custom Camera & Player Paths

The game supports **dual custom paths** for cinematic camera movements and realistic player transitions between covers.

### Path Types

**Camera Paths:**
- Create dramatic overhead sweeps and cinematic camera movements
- Independent from player movement
- Default: Gentle overhead arc (30% of distance, max 3m height)

**Player Paths:**
- Define realistic running/movement routes between covers
- Stay close to ground for authentic character animation
- Default: Low tactical path (0.5m height)

### Quick Start

1. **Enable Plugin:** Project → Settings → Plugins → "Path Creator"
2. **Select CoverPoint:** Choose any cover in your scene
3. **Path Creator Panel:** Appears in Inspector when CoverPoint is selected
4. **Create Paths:**
   - Select origin node → Click "Pick"
   - Select destination node → Click "Pick"
   - Choose direction (Left, Right, Forward, Back)
   - Choose type (Camera or Player)
   - Click "Create Path"
5. **Edit:** Path is auto-selected - adjust curves in 3D viewport

**Inspector-Based:** Clean interface integrated into Inspector panel for streamlined workflow!

### Path Properties (per CoverPoint)

```gdscript
# Camera paths (cinematic)
forward_camera_path: Path3D
back_camera_path: Path3D
left_camera_path: Path3D
right_camera_path: Path3D

# Player paths (movement)
forward_player_path: Path3D
back_player_path: Path3D
left_player_path: Path3D
right_player_path: Path3D
```

### Usage in Code

```gdscript
# Get paths
var camera_path = cover.get_camera_path("forward")
var player_path = cover.get_player_path("forward")

# Both camera and player follow their respective paths (if defined)
camera.transition_to_cover(next_cover, side, camera_path)
await player.move_to_cover(next_cover, side, player_path)
```

## Common Operations

### Adding a New Cover Point (Simplified Workflow)

**Step 1: Create the Cover**
1. Add new Node3D to your level scene
2. Change type to `CoverPoint` (or instance `cover_point.tscn` if you have a template)
3. Position it where you want the cover to be
4. Give it a descriptive name (e.g., "Cover_Entrance")

**Step 2: Configure Properties**
1. Select the CoverPoint in the scene tree
2. In the Inspector, set:
   - **Height**: Choose `MEDIUM` (crouch) or `TALL` (stand)
   - **Active Sides**: Check "Left" and/or "Right" (both enabled by default)
   - **Cover Name**: Optional debug label
   - **Movement Timing**: Adjust camera/player transition speeds if needed

**Step 3: Auto-Generate Anchors**
1. Scroll down to the "Cover Setup & Path Tools" panel in Inspector
2. Click the **"🔧 Setup Cover Anchors"** button
3. All 4 anchors (2 player, 2 camera) are created and positioned automatically!

**Step 4: Connect to Other Covers**
1. In the "Connections" group, set:
   - `left_cover` - Cover to the left
   - `right_cover` - Cover to the right
   - `forward_cover` - Cover in front
   - `back_cover` - Cover behind
2. These create the movement graph for the level

**Step 5: Create Custom Paths (Optional)**
1. For each direction, choose starting side ("From Left" or "From Right")
2. Enter target node path in the text field:
   - For camera paths: `TargetCover/CameraAnchor_Left` (or Right)
   - For player paths: `TargetCover/PlayerAnchor_Left` (or Right)
   - Tip: Right-click node in scene tree → Copy Node Path
3. Click **"Create"** next to "Camera" or "Player"
4. Path is automatically created with smart curve defaults
5. Click **"Edit"** to fine-tune the curve shape in 3D viewport

**Benefits of Manual Target Selection:**
- Connect to any Node3D in your scene (not just cover anchors)
- Create asymmetric paths (different entry/exit points)
- Full control over path endpoints for complex level layouts

**That's it!** GameManager auto-collects covers on level load.

### Adjusting Shooting Timing
1. Open Player scene in editor
2. Select Player node
3. Adjust in Inspector:
   - `step_out_speed`: Higher = faster step-out
   - `step_in_delay`: Time before returning to cover
   - `shoot_cooldown`: Minimum time between shots

### Testing Cover Flow
1. Run test_level.tscn
2. Player starts at first cover
3. Swipe horizontally to move between covers
4. Tap to shoot at cursor position
5. Drag to look around while in cover

---

## Known Limitations / TODO

### Current Limitations
- Placeholder capsule mesh (no rigged character yet)
- Procedural animation only (no imported animations)
- No weapon firing VFX/SFX
- No enemy AI/targeting
- No damage system
- Basic swipe detection (no diagonal movement)

### Next Steps
1. Import rigged character with cover animations
2. Add weapon firing system (raycast + VFX)
3. Implement enemy AI and targeting
4. Add damage/health system
5. Create multiple cover points with cover-to-cover paths
6. Add UI (health, ammo, crosshair)
7. Polish animation transitions

---

## Technical Notes

### Godot 4.2+ Specifics
- Using `@export_group` for property organization
- AnimationTree with typed NodePaths
- Input handling via `_input()` with InputEvent
- Async timing with `await get_tree().create_timer()`

### Performance Considerations
- Single AnimationTree per player (lightweight)
- Camera raycast only on tap (not per-frame)
- Cover points use simple Node3D (no physics overhead)
- Animation blending happens on GPU

### Mobile Optimization
- Touch input handled in camera controller
- Swipe threshold tunable for different screen sizes
- Look sensitivity adjustable for device variation
- No continuous raycasting (battery friendly)

## Questions / Future Decisions

1. **Enemy Placement:** Should enemies be tied to specific cover points or free-roaming?
2. **Cover Damage:** Can cover be destroyed? Does it degrade?
3. **Movement Timing:** Should cover-to-cover movement be instant or animated?
4. **Weapon System:** Single weapon or multiple? Reloading mechanics?
5. **Difficulty Scaling:** How to increase challenge across levels?
